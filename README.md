ATTENTION for test

In class TestCase, it will read the input file to get the original orders and the insert orders.

1. The txt file should save under the inputOrders file folder.
   The path is "./src/inputFiles/fileName" 

2. Buy orders and sell orders should be saved in different files

3. Insert orders and original orders should be saved in different files

4. In the order file, the first column is the price of the order, the second column is the amount. 
   In the range file, the first column is the minimum number, and the second column is the maximum number.
   Two columns are split by comma.

5. One line only has one order, which means two orders are spit by line break.

6. The sample test input files are put in my program.

   a. BuyOrders.txt : it contains the original buy orders
   b. SellOrders.txt : it contains the original sell orders
   c. InsertBuyOrders.txt : it contains the buy orders which should be inserted
   d. InsertSellOrders.txt : it contains the sell orders which should be inserted
   e. rangeOfBuyPrice.txt : it contains the range of the price of buy orders
   f. srangeOfSellPrice.txt : it contains the range of the price of sell orders
